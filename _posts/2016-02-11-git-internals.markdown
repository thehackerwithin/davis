This is a test

## Git Internals

Instructional materials will be added here before the meeting. Please check
back.

## Prerequisites

You should have basic familiarity with
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) and/or other version
control systems. Additionally, we will be using basic
[BASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) commands and some
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29)
scripts, so basics in programming will be helpful. Be sure to install the
needed software shown below before coming to the tutorial.

## Installation

The linked installation instructions will setup a basic environment on your
operating system of choice (Windows, Mac, Linux) that will give you access to
BASH, Python, Git, and R. In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.
